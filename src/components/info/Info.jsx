        My name is Niklas Wallenborg, and I&rsquo;m a creative developer and
        interdisciplinary artist. &quot;Creative Coding Sundays&quot; is a hobby
        project of mine, aimed at evolving and learning as a creative developer.
        I&rsquo;ll try to do a new creative coding project each
        week&mdash;whether big or small&mdash;and share it here every Sunday.
